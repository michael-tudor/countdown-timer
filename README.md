# How to Create a Sense of Urgency on Your Website to Boost Sales?

Creating a sense of urgency can instill a Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) in users, significantly increasing the number of inquiries without any extra investment.

One way to do this is by using a countdown timer. Show how much time is left until the end of the promotion. This visual cue encourages quick decision-making.
